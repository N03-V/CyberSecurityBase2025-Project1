A simple notes app where users can make public and private notes.
Used for showing security flaws.

Please run this in a virtual environment, instructions are in my essay.

<pre>
Existing users:

username:    password:
alice        redqueen
bob          squarepants
admin        adminpassword
</pre>

A normal user can view and edit the notes that they have made. They can't edit public notes made by others, but can view them.

The app was made by following this tutorial https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/note-taking-app-using-django/, slightly modified.
